# YOLOX
Nanodet: YOLOX is an anchor-free version of YOLO, with a simpler design but better performance! It aims to bridge the gap between research and industrial communities. YOLOX is a high-performing object detector, an improvement to the existing YOLO series. YOLO series are in constant exploration of techniques to improve the object detection techniques for optimal speed and accuracy trade-off for real-time applications.
